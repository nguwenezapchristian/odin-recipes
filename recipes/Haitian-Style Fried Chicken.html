        <h1>Haitian-Style Fried Chicken</h1>

        <p>
            This Haitian fried chicken recipe varies from American-style fried chicken<br>
            but is just as good. If you are in a hurry, you can marinate the chicken for<br>
            30 minutes, but the longer you leave it, the better. You may sprinkle freshly<br>
            squeezed lemon juice on top if you like.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds chicken legs</li>
            <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>Â½ white onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 head garlic, cloves separated and minced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons seasoned salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons paprika</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons ground thyme</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole cloves</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken legs, lemon juice, onion, garlic,<br>
                seasoned salt, paprika, thyme, pepper, and cloves<br>
                in a large bowl. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator<br>
                for at least 30 minutes to 12 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan over medium-high<br>
                heat. Fry chicken in batches until golden brown, about 8 minutes.<br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read<br>
                165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain on paper towels.
