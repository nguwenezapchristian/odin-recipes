        <p>
            This Haitian fried chicken recipe varies from American-style fried chicken<br>
            but is just as good. If you are in a hurry, you can marinate the chicken for<br>
            30 minutes, but the longer you leave it, the better. You may sprinkle freshly<br>
            squeezed lemon juice on top if you like.
