        <h1>Fried Black-Eye Peas</h1>

        <p>
            Black-eyed pea patties made with bacon, shallots, and roasted red peppers are pan-fried<br>
            until golden brown and crispy. This recipe calls for canned peas, but for more flavor,<br>
            I sometimes use leftover peas that I cooked with ham hocks or smoked turkey from New Year's.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound bacon</li>
            <li>3 cups canned black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped roasted red peppers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat,<br>
                turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.<br>
                Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
            </li>
            <li>Mash black-eyed peas in a bowl with a fork. Crumble bacon<br>
                into the bowl, then stir in red peppers and shallot. Stir in<br>
                enough flour to make the mixture stick together. Season with<br>
                salt and pepper and form into four equal patties.
            </li>
            <li>Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat until<br>
                butter melts. Add patties and cook until golden brown and crispy,<br>
                about 4 minutes per side.
            </li>
        </ol>
