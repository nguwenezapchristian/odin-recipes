        <p>
            Black-eyed pea patties made with bacon, shallots, and roasted red peppers are pan-fried<br>
            until golden brown and crispy. This recipe calls for canned peas, but for more flavor,<br>
            I sometimes use leftover peas that I cooked with ham hocks or smoked turkey from New Year's.
