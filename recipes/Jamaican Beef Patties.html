        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons curry powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
            <li>¼ cup shortening</li>
            <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Prepare pastry: Combine flour, curry powder, and salt in a bowl.<br>
                Cut in margarine and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br>
                Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Shape dough into a log and<br>
                cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle<br>
                (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare filling: Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat.<br>
                Sauté onion until soft and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ground beef;<br>
                season with curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly,<br>
                until beef is evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs.<br>
                Simmer until liquid is absorbed; remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle. Fold over and<br>
                press edges together, making a half-circle. Use the back of a fork to seal edges,<br>
                then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
